When you need to send query parameters along with your URL, you can extend the URL structure to include them. Here's a suggestion on how you can structure your URLs to accommodate query parameters:

```
http://yourapi.com/api/{entity}/{action}?{query1}&{query2}&...
```

In this structure:

- **Base URL**: `http://yourapi.com/api/` - This remains the base URL for your API.
- **Entity**: `{entity}` - Represents the entity or resource you are acting upon.
- **Action**: `{action}` - Represents the action you want to perform on the entity.
- **Query Parameters**: `?{query1}&{query2}&...` - These are optional parameters that you can include to provide additional information to the API endpoint.

Here's an example URL with query parameters:

```
GET http://yourapi.com/api/products/search?category=electronics&price_range=0-100
```

In this example:

- `products` is the entity (resource) being acted upon.
- `search` is the action being performed.
- `category=electronics` and `price_range=0-100` are query parameters providing additional information about the search criteria.

This structure allows you to include query parameters as needed while maintaining a clear and organized URL structure. Make sure to properly handle and parse these query parameters in your backend logic to extract the necessary information for processing the request.
